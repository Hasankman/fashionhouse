# FashionHouse Application

By Hasan Esat Kayman 

### Introduction

  I have created a Fashion House of BackEnd system, created using Java Spring Boot, PostMan and MySQL. My project will be futher developed and linked to front end to fully function for user interaction and the transfer of data from the the database of products and meet the  needs of the Fashion House. I have created varios Crud operations like (Create, Read, Update, Delete and read by a certain statment like Name or Id or Size) the operations will help us understand how the front end will comunicate with our database and how certian operations would work. i have created two tabels as a start which will be futher developed by adding customers and a size tabel when we take our business global. This READ ME file is a breife intorduction of my project and how my project is functioning so far.
